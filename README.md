Pharmacy Website Project (HTML & CSS)
I created a pharmacy website using HTML and CSS. The project includes multiple pages such as Home, About Us, Services, Contact, and a Products page. It features a clean, responsive design with user-friendly navigation. The purpose of the website is to provide information about pharmacy services, display available medicines, and allow customers to easily find contact details or location.
